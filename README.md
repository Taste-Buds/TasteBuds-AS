What problem does this app address: 

Users today are unable to create and share restaurant reviews among Facebook friend lists easily.
Users are also unable to find restaurant recommendations based on their friends choices.
Additionally, users are unable to communicate and view what dishes theyâ€™ve tried and might recommend.
There is no easy way to follow people whose taste in food matches with a user.


How does this app solve that problem: 
Taste Buds makes it easier to log and share food and restaurant recommendations with friends. It also makes it trivial to get food recommendations from friends you know and value their inputs. With Taste buds, no more of going to restaurants recommended by strangers with different taste, ordering the wrong food at a good restaurant and forgetting what you ate the last time you were at a restaurant.
